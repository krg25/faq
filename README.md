# Extra Feature: Answer Replies
For my extra feature I allowed users to reply to answers to ask for/provide extra information, or to tell them they are right or wrong. 
On sites such as stackoverflow, users can reply to answers without adding a whole answer, so I figured this would be fitting.

To use this feature:
1. Login to an account, or create a new one
2. Navigate to an open question, or create one if one does not exist
3. Navigate to an answer, or create one
4. Click the button below the anser marked "Reply to Answer"
5. Write your reply and submit it
